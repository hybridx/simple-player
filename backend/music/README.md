# Music Directory

Place your music files in this directory. The backend supports the following audio formats:

- **MP3** (`.mp3`)
- **WAV** (`.wav`)
- **OGG** (`.ogg`)
- **M4A** (`.m4a`)
- **FLAC** (`.flac`)

## File Naming Convention

For best results, name your files in the format: `Artist - Title.ext`

**Examples:**
- `The Beatles - Hey Jude.mp3`
- `Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody.mp3`
- `Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb.flac`

Files that don't follow this format will display as "Unknown Artist".

## Getting Started

1. Copy your music files to this directory
2. Start the backend server: `npm start`
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080/tracks` to see your music listed
4. Open the frontend to start playing music!

**Note:** This directory is created automatically when you start the backend server.
